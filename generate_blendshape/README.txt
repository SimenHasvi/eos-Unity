modify NeutralHead to whatever expression you want and place them in the expressions folder in obj format.

you can generate your own with python3 obj_to_blendshape.py expressions/ NeutralHead.obj blendshapes.txt after you place your expression files in the expressions folder

Do not change the vertex order when modifying, the mesh, in blender you need to select these options when importing and exporting
